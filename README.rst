Kitware Image and Video Exploitation and Retrieval
--------------------------------------------------

The KWIVER toolkit is a collection of software tools designed to
tackle challenging image and video analysis problems and other related
challenges. Recently started by Kitwareâ€™s Computer Vision and
Scientific Visualization teams, KWIVER is an ongoing effort to
transition technology developed over multiple years to the open source
domain to further research, collaboration, and product development.
KWIVER is a collection of C++ libraries with C and Python bindings
and uses an permissive `BSD License <LICENSE>`_.

One of the primary design goals of KWIVER is to make it easier to pull
together algorithms from a wide variety of third-party, open source 
image and video processing projects and integrate them into highly
modular, run-time configurable systems.  This goal is achieved through
the three main components of KWIVER: Vital, Arrows, and Sprokit.

Vital
-----
Vital is core of KWIVER and is designed to provide data and algorithm
abstractions with minimal library dependencies.  Vital only depends on
the C++ standard library and the header-only Eigen_ library.  Vital defines
the core data types and abstract interfaces for core vision algorithms
using these types.  Vital also provides various system utility functions
like logging, plugin management, and configuration file handling.  Vital
does **not** provide implementations of the abstract algorithms.
Implementations are found in Arrows and are loaded dynamically at run-time
via plugins.

The design of KWIVER allows end-user applications to link only against
the Vital libraries and have minimal hard dependencies.  One can then
dynamically add algorithmic capabilities, with new dependencies, via
plugins without needing to recompile Vital or the application code.
Only Vital is built by default when building KWIVER without enabling
any options in CMake. 

Arrows
------
Arrows is the collection of plugins that provides implementations of the
algorithms declared in Vital.  Each arrow can be enabled or disabled
in build process through CMake options.  Most arrows bring in additional
third-party dependencies and wrap the capabilities of those libraries
to make them accessible through the Vital APIs.  The code in Arrows
also converts or wrap data types from these external libraries into
Vital data types.  This allows interchange of data between algorithms
from different arrows using Vital types as the intermediary.

Capabilities are currently organized into Arrows based on what third
party library they require.  However, this arrangement is not required
and may change as the number of algorithms and arrows grows.  Some
arrows, like `core <arrows/core>`_, require no additional dependencies.
Some examples of the provided Arrows are:

* `ocv <arrows/ocv>`__ - provides algorithms from OpenCV_
* `ceres <arrows/ceres>`__ - provides algorithms from `Ceres Solver`_
* `vxl <arrow/vxl>`__ - provides algorithms from VXL_

Sprokit
-------
Sprokit is a "**S**\ tream **Pro**\ cessing Tool\ **kit**" that provides
infrastructure for chaining together algorithms into pipelines for
processing streaming data sources.  The most common use case of Sprokit
is for video processing, but Sprokit is data type agnostic and could be
used for any type of streaming data.  Sprokit allows the user to dynamically
connect and configure a pipeline by chaining together processing nodes
called "processes" into a directed graph with data sources and sinks.
Sprokit schedules the jobs to run each process and keep data flowing through
pipeline.  Sprokit also allows processes written in Python to be
interconnected with those written in C++.

Building KWIVER
===============

Fletch
------

KWIVER has (and will have more) a number of dependencies on 3rd party
Open Source libraries.  To make it easier to build KWIVER, especially
on systems like Microsoft Windows that don't have package manager,
Fletch_ was developed to gather, configure and build those packages
for use with KWIVER.  Fletch is a CMake_ based "super-build" that
takes care of most of the build details for you.

.. _Fletch: https://github.com/Kitware/fletch
.. _CMake: https://www.cmake.org

To build Fletch, refer to the README file in that repository.


kwiver
------

Once Fletch has been built, it's possible to build the `kwiver`
repository as well.  This repo is also a CMake build and can be
fetched with this command::

	git clone https://github.com/Kitware/kwiver.git

The build can be configured with this command::

	cmake -DKWIVER_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=ON -DKWIVER_ENABLE_ARROWS:BOOL=ON -DKWIVER_ENABLE_PROCESSES:BOOL=ON -DKWIVER_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON -DKWIVER_ENABLE_TOOLS:BOOL=ON -DKWIVER_USE_BUILD_TREE:BOOL=ON -DKWIVER_ENABLE_VXL:BOOL=ON -DKWIVER_ENABLE_SPROKIT:BOOL=ON -DKWIVER_ENABLE_OPENCV:BOOL=ON -Dfletch_DIR:PATH=/path/to/fletch/build/directory /path/to/kwiver/source/directory

As with Fletch, if you want to specify a particular Python
installation (such as Anaconda) use the the `-DPYTHON...` command
arguments as outlined in the Fletch section.

Once your `cmake` command has completed, use `make` (on Linux) to build it.


Running KWIVER
==============

Once you've built KWIVER, you'll want to test that it's working on
your system.  From a command prompt execute the following command::

	source </path/to/kwiver/build>/install/setup_KWIVER.sh

Where `</path/to/kwiver/build>` is the actual path of your KWIVER CMake build directory.

This will set up your PATH, PYTHONPATH and other environment variables
to allow KWIVER to work conveniently.

The central component of KWIVER is vital which supplies basic data
types and fundimental alrogithms.  In addition, we use sprokit's
pipelining facilities to manage, integrate and run many of KWIVER's
modules and capabilities.  To see what modules (called processes in
sprockit) are available, run the following command::

    $ plugin_explorer --process -b

Here's a typical list of modules (note that as KWIVER expands, this
list is likely to grow):

This is the list of modules that can be included in a Sprokit
pipeline.  We're going to use the `numbers` module and the the
`print_number` module to create a very simple pipeline.  To learn more
about the `numbers` module we'll again use `plugin_explorer` this time
to get details on a particular module.  For `numbers` we'll use the
following command::

    $ plugin_explorer --process --type numbers -d --config

    Factories that create type "sprokit::process"

      Process type: numbers
      Description:        Outputs numbers within a range

        Properties: _no_reentrant,
        -- Configuration --
        Name       : end
        Default    : 100
        Description: The value to stop counting at.
        Tunable    : no

        Name       : start
        Default    : 0
        Description: The value to start counting at.
        Tunable    : no

      Input ports:
      Output ports:
        Name       : number
        Type       : integer
        Flags      : _required,
        Description: Where the numbers will be available.

And for `print_number`, we'll use::

    $ plugin_explorer --process --type print_number -d --config

    Factories that create type "sprokit::process"

      Process type: print_number
      Description:        Print numbers to a file

        Properties: _no_reentrant,
        -- Configuration --
        Name       : output
        Default    :
        Description: The path of the file to output to.
        Tunable    : no

      Input ports:
        Name       : number
        Type       : integer
        Flags      : _required,
        Description: Where numbers are read from.

      Output ports:


The output of these commands tells us enough about each process to
construct a Sprockit ".pipe" file that defines a processing pipeline.
In particular we'll need to know how to configure each process (the
"Configuration") and how they can be hooked together (the input and
output "Ports").

KWIVER comes with a sample
[sprokit/pipelines/number_flow.pipe](sprokit/pipelines/number_flow.pipe)
file that configures and connects the pipeline so that the `numbers`
process will generate a set of integers from 1 to 99 and the
`print_number` process will write those to a file called
`numbers.txt`.  Of particular interest is the section at the end of
the file that actually "hooks up" the pipeline.

To run the pipeline, we'll use the Sprokit `pipeline_runner` command::

    $ pipeline_runner -p </path/to/kwiver/source>/sprokit/pipelines/number_flow.pipe

After the pipeline completes, you should find a file, `numbers.txt`, in your working directory.


Python Processes
----------------

One of KWIVER's great strengths (as provided by sprokit) is the
ability to create hybrid pipelines which combine C++ and Python
processes in the same pipeline.  This greatly facilitates prototyping
complex processing pipelines.  To test this out we'll still use the
`numbers` process, but we'll use a Python version of the
`print_number` process called `kw_print_number_process` the code for
which can be seen in
[sprokit/processes/python/kw_print_number_process.py](sprokit/processes/python/kw_print_number_process.py).
As usual, we can lean about this process with the following command::

    $ plugin_explorer --process --type kw_print_number_process -d --config

    Process type: kw_print_number_process
      Description: A Simple Kwiver Test Process
      Properties: _no_reentrant, _python
    Configuration:
      Name       : output
      Default    : .
      Description: The path for the output file.
      Tunable    : no

    Input ports:
      Name       : input
      Type       : integer
      Flags      : _required
      Description: Where numbers are read from.

    Output ports:

As you can see, the process is very similar to the C++ `print_number`
process.  As a result, the [".pipe" file is very
similar](sprokit/pipelines/number_flow_python.pipe).

In order to get around limitations imposed by the Python Global
Interpreter Lock, we'll use a different Sprokit scheduler for this
pipeline.  The `pythread_per_process` scheduler which does essentially
what it says: it creates a Python thread for every process in the
pipeline::

	pipeline_runner -S pythread_per_process -p </path/to/kwiver/source>/sprokit/pipelines/number_flow_python.pipe>

As with the previous pipeline, the numbers will be written to an output file, this time `numbers_from_python.txt`



vital
=====

Vital is an open source C++ collection of libraries and tools that
supply basic types and services to the Kitware KWIVER imagery tool
kit.

Overview of Directories
-----------------------

* CMake -- contains CMake helper scripts
* tests -- contains testing related support code
* vital -- contains the core library source and headers
* vital/algo -- contains abstract algorithm definitions
* vital/bindings -- contains C and Python bindings
* vital/config -- contains configuration support code
* vital/exceptions -- contains the exception class hierarchy
* vital/io -- contains the classes that support reading and writing core data types
* vital/kwiversys -- contains the code that supports the OS abstraction layer
* vital/logger -- contains the classes that provide logging support

* vital/tools -- contains source for command line utilities
* vital/types -- contains the source for the core data types
* vital/util --   contains the source for general purpose utilities
* vital/video_metadata -- contains the classes that support video metadata


Running CMake
-------------

We recommend building kwiver out of the source directory to prevent
mixing source files with compiled products.  Create a build directory
in parallel with the kwiver source directory.  From the command line,
enter the empty build directory and run::

    $ ccmake /path/to/kwiver/source

where the path above is the location of your kwiver source tree.  The
ccmake tool allows for interactive selection of CMake options.
Alternatively, using the CMake GUI you can set the source and build
directories accordingly and press the "Configure" button.


CMake Options
=============

* CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE -- The compiler mode, usually Debug or Release
* CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX -- The path to where you want the kwiver build products to install
* KWIVER_BUILD_SHARED -- Build shared or static libraries
* KWIVER_ENABLE_ARROWS -- Enable algorithm implementations
* KWIVER_ENABLE_DOCS -- Turn on building the Doxygen documentation
* KWIVER_ENABLE_LOG4CLUS -- Enable log4cplus logger back end
* KWIVER_ENABLE_PYTHON -- Enable the python bindings
* KWIVER_ENABLE_TESTS -- Build the unit tests
* KWIVER_USE_BUILD_TREE -- When building the plugin manager, whether to include the build directory in the search path.
* KWIVER_ENABLE_C_BINDINGS -- Whether to build the C bindings
* fletch_DIR -- Build directory for the Fletch support packages.

There are many more options

Dependencies
------------

Vital has minimal required dependencies. Sprokit pipeline framework
relies on boost.  Arrows and sprokit processes are structured so that
the code that depends on an external package is in a directory with
the major dependency name (e.g. vxl, ocv). The dependencies can be
turned ON or OFF through CMake variables.
