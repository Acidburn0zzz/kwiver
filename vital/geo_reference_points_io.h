 * Initializes and uses a local_geo_cs object given to transform reference
 * landmarks into a local coordinate system. The newly initialized lgcs is
 * passed back up by reference. Previous initialization of the given \c lgcs
 * is overwritten.
 *
 * The reference file should be of the format
 * (lm=landmark, tNsM=track N state M):
 *
 *    lm1.x lm1.y lm1.z t1s1.frame t1s1.x t1s1.y t1s2.frame t1s2.x t1s2.y ...
 *    lm2.x lm2.y lm2.z t2s1.frame t2s1.x t2s1.y t2s2.frame t2s2.x t2s2.y ...
 *    ...
 *
 * At least 3 landmarks must be given, with at least 2 track states recorded
 * for each landmark, for transformation to converge, however more of each is
 * recommended.
 *
 * Landmark Z position, or altitude, should be given in meters.
