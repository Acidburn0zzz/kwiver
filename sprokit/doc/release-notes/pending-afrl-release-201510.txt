sprokit Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to sprokit which
require public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the
changes and corresponding notes below will be encorporated into a
public numbered release version, and the content of this file will be
reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

 * General upgrading internal and external documentation.

 * Convert runtime status notification to use vital logger rather than
   writing to cout/cerr.

 * Convert main source code to use vital config blocks and remove
   sprokit config support files. This change unifies config handling
   using vital config classes. This allows inter-operation between
   vital, maptk, sprokit and kwiver processes.

 * Added methods to sprokit process base class to make the internal
   process logger available to derived classes.


Build System

 * Updated library specifications to establish library
   visibility. Dependent librarys are separated into public and
   private groups to better limit side effects of unintentional public
   linkage.

 * Adding build options to require all dependent libraries be
   explicitly specified.

 * Building sprokit requires c++0x standard support at a minimum and
   will use c++11 if available.
