release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Added a core implementation of "filter_tracks" which applies filters based
   on track length or based on importance of the track in covering a match matrix.

 * Added a video_input algorithm for image lists that treats a sequence of
   images files like a video, using an image_io algorithm to load each frame.

 * Added a video_input algorithm for POS files that produces a metadata-only
   stream out of POS files associated with a list of images.  Each image file
   name is matched to a POS file with the same basename in a specified metadata
   directory.

 * Added a video_input algorithm that splits imagery and metadata between two
   other video_input sources.  For example this implementation can combine the
   images from an image_list video_input and metadata from a POS video_input.

 * Added a video_input filter algorithm that reads data from another
   video_input instance and reduces the frame range or adjusts frame timing.

Vital

 * Added a "filter_tracks" abstract algorithm to apply filters to feature tracks

 * Added new methods "read_pos_file" and "write_pos_file" in the video_metadata
   library to read AFRL POS files directly into a video_metadata structure and
   write POS files from a video_metadata structure.

 * Added new video_metadata tags corresponding to fields that are required for
   POS files.
