Updates since last public release
---------------------------------
Arrows - Ceres

 * Added a Ceres implementation of the optimize_cameras abstract algorithm.
   This implmentation is very similar to the bundle_adjust algorithm but
   does not modify the landmarks.

 * Refactored common config options and helper functions between
   optimize_cameras and bundle_adjust into new shared classes in options.h.
   This makes it much easer to create a new Ceres solver algorihm and
   reuse the same solver options or camera options.


Fixes since last public release
